Herewith my rebuttal to the review of "Light inextensible strings..."
The referee's comments are preceded by a chevron (">") and my response
is inline.  I have tinkered with linebreaks here and there in the
interests of clarity, and have replaced some mathematical notation in
the original review with latex equivalents.

Short story: I agree with all the comments made and have modified the
manuscript accordingly; changes appear in the manuscript using colour
coding for ease of reference.  The document is stronger, more
cohesive, more accurate, and hopefully more instructive; and I commend
it to you.

I was unaware of the derivation in Taylor and Wheeler that the
reviewer points me to.  I did not want to suggest that equation 2 was
new, but was unable to find a derivation of it in the literature.  I
have cited Taylor and Wheeler (but see my response to Q6 below).

I think the sentence in question was technically correct but
potentially misleading.  What I wanted to do was to make readers think
about taut thread in the context of GR.  I didn't want to consider
geodesics at this point in the introduction, or free-falling elevator
frames.  I want to focus on taut string.

[one of the conceptual difficulties in preparing the manuscript, as
pointed out by a previous reviewer, is that the string is not in a
freely-falling elevator frame; as the reviewer points out, such string
does not follow a geodesic path in any meaningful sense].

I have rephrased the sentence which now reads: "Here I consider the
path adopted by a stationary, light inexensible string under tension
passing between two fixed points, and consider the extent to which the
expression "straight line" would be applicable to such an object".

This is a much better way of phrasing the argument and I have
rephrased as suggested.

I have totally rephrased that part of the manuscript using this
suggestion and it is much clearer (I have also changed uppercase L for
lowercase l as per suggestion number 7.

On reflection the dominant energy condition is not really an
appropriate or informative or useful or interesting concept for the
intended readership.  The important thing is that tension greater $\mu
c^2$ is unphysical and this context, the unphysicality is manifested
by transverse waves travelling faster than light.

In answer to the question, we may take the stress-energy tensor for a
stretched string to be diagonal with elements $\mu,-T,0,0$.  Then the
dominant energy condition is that, for any future-pointing causal
vector, $-T^\mu_\nu V^\nu$ must also be a future-pointing causal
vector.  We can see directly that if $T>\mu$ the DEC is violated.

But this is a massive digression to the main thrust of the manuscript
and any adequate pedagogical explanation would be an intrusive
distraction.  It is like using a slegehammer to crack a nut.  I have
removed any reference to the DEC on these grounds, and further
emphasised the unphysicality of the wave speed being $>c$.

The referee is absolutely correct here and raises an important point.
When I said that the circumference was "trivially" $2\pi r$, what I
meant was that integrating equation (1) from $phi=0$ to $2\pi$ at
fixed $t,r,\theta$ was trivial.  The resulting proper string length is
a direct consequence of the *definition* of "r" [which is sometimes
called the circumferential radial coordinate].

This comment has made me realise that the $2\pi r$ proper string
length is actually the simplest proper length calculation possible in
the Schwarzschild metric, and I have rephrased accordingly, and I hope
it is more instructive.  I remember struggling with this myself as an
undergraduate (I wanted to know what the "real" radius was ...).
Einstein himself said "it is not so easy to free oneself from the idea
that coordinates must have an immediate metrical meaning", so I have
good company!

Factor of M now added (actually this caused me some considerable
confusion and uncertainty.  The equation presented in Taylor and
Wheeler has a factor of 2M but it should be M---see the attached
mathematica screenshot, plus the identity arctanh(x) =
log((1+x)/(1-x))/2.  In the same section Taylor and Wheeler discuss
one-centimeter long rulers laid end to end many times, a good metaphor
for proper length.

This was just a typo in that particular line and has no effect on any
other part of the manuscript.

corrected, now using $\ell$ consistently for proper length.

Fixed, now reads "consider the proper length from $r=2M$ to
$r=2M(1+w)$ where $w$ is small, $0<w\ll 1$".

In mathematical usage (but not in general usage, at least according to
the OED) there is a distinction between "arbitrary" and "arbitrarily".
One usually uses phrases like "arbitrarily large" to convey the idea
that some object may become as large as one desires.

In the manuscript the wording was "radial strings are arbitrarily
longer than flat space would imply", which I think gets the intended
meaning across.

In this case we have the startling result that the discrepancy
approaches infinity ("becomes arbitrarily large") as w approaches
infinity.  I have not seen this result explictly before, yet am
reluctant to claim that it is truly new: after all it is a simple
consequence of a known result (equation 3).  But it is certainly
startling, to me at least.

In any case the original wording was somewhat terse and I have
rephrased.  The manuscript now explicitly states that the discrepancy
in proper length between the Schwarzschild and Euclidean results
approaches infinity as w approaches infinity.

Fixed, notation now consistent

The equation given as $u''=3u^2/2-u$ gives the path of a beam of light
through Schwarzschild space ideally in terms of $r$ as a function of
angle, $r=r(\phi)$.  The idea is that a stationary observer has a
laser pointer pointing in a particular direction, switches it on and
leaves it on for a long time.  We then record all the points that the
beam touches.  The path of the light is then simply $r=r(\phi)$, no
time coordinate involved, as Figures 4 and 6 show.  I have changed the
citation to Rindler, who gives a detailed derivation.

There are two separate issues here.  Firstly, null geodesic paths in
the Schwarzschild metric obey $u''=3u^2/2-u$ where $u=2M/r$.  This is
equivalent to $r''(\phi) = r-3M + 2(r')^2/r$.  The second issue is
straight lines in Euclidean flat space (in flat space the expression
"straight lne" is unambiguous).  WLOG $\phi_0=0$ and if
$r=r_0\sec\phi$ then $r'=-r_0\sin\phi\cdot\sec^2\phi$ and
$r''=r_0(\sec\phi + 2\sin^2\phi\sec^3\phi$, from which $r''=2(r')^2/r$
follows from cancellation.

One can "go the other way"---that is, given ODE $r''=r+2(r')^2/r$, one
can deriving $r=r_0\sec\phi$---by substituting $u=1/r$ and obtaining
$u''+u=0$, whence $u=A\cos(\phi-\phi_0)$.

I have rephrased slightly and numbered one of the equations so I can
refer to it.

Everything can be resolved and clarified by omitting the word
"tangential" which was misleading, and replacing "small" with
"negligible".  The sentence now reads "If $r'$ is negligible, then a
string follows $r''=r-2M$, while null geodesics follow $r''=r-3M$".

The $r''=r-3M$ is just the (new) equation 7 -viz
$r''\left(\phi\right)=r-3M+2\left(r'\right)^2/r$ but with $r'=0$.

Not any more! All the software used to create the diagrams is now
publically available under version control at

https://github.com/RobinHankin/string

and I have added a citation to this repo.  The code is heavily
documented.
