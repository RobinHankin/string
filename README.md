General relativity in R: light inextensible string in the Schwarzschild metric
================

# Overview

The `string` repo contains software that simulates light inextensible
string in the Schwarzschild metric by numerical soluion of a
second-order ODE.  The software is available under the GPL and runs
under the R programming language; a `Makefile` is provided that runs
the software and creates a range of publication-quality PDF images.
Extensive documentation is available inline and in physics-oriented
tex files.
