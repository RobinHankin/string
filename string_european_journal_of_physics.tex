\begin{abstract}

Light inextensible string under tension is a stalwart feature of
elementary physics.  Here I show how considering such string in the
vicinity of a black hole, with the help of computer algebra systems,
can generate insight into the Schwarzschild geometry in the context of
a variational calculus problem.  Light taut strings minimize their
proper length, given by integrating the spatial component of the
Schwarzschild metric along the string.  The path itself is given by
straightforward numerical solution to the Euler-Lagrange equations.
If the string is entirely outside the event horizon, its closest
approach to the singularity is tangential.  At this point the string
is {\em visibly} curved, surely a memorable and informative insight.
The geometry of the Schwarzschild metric induces some interesting
nonlocal phenomena: if the distance of closest approach is less than
about $1.0761\cdot 2M$, the string self-intersects, even though it is
everywhere under tension.  Light taut strings furnish a third
interpretation of the concept ``straight line'', the other two being
null geodesics and free-fall world lines.

\section{Introduction}

Light inextensible string under tension is a stalwart feature of
elementary physics.  Here I consider how light inextensible string
behaves in the vicinity of a black hole; and use this to interpret the
concept of ``straight line'' in curved spacetime.

A light string's being under tension means that its path will be an
extremum of proper length.  In flat space, the calculus of variations
proves that the path is straight in the sense of zero curvature.  In
terrestrial gravity, standard $25\times
10^{-6}\unit{kg}\cdot\unit{m}^{-1}$ cotton sewing thread at its breaking
strain of about $40\unit{N}$ would have a sag of~$\sim 6\times
10^{-6}\unit{m}$ over a $1\unit{m}$ horizontal scale: barely perceptible.
How does such a quotidian observation translate into the vicinity of a
black hole?  Would the ``warping of space'' result in {\em visibly}
curved thread?

Of course, no real string is perfectly weightless or inextensible.
With tension~$T$, gravitational acceleration $g$ and (proper) mass per
(proper) unit length~$\mu$, then a string will behave as though light
on lengthscales $L\lesssim T/\left(\mu g\right)$.  Using
$c^4/\left(4GM\right)$ for the strength of gravity at the event
horizon of a black hole with mass $M$ gives $L\lesssim TM/\left(\mu
c^4\right)$.  For the string to behave as though light on lengthscales
comparable with the Schwarzschild radius would require $T\gtrsim\mu
c^2$.  Exceeding this criterion would violate the dominant energy
condition (and in this context we note that transverse waves would
propagate at speed~$\sqrt{T/\mu}\sim c$).  Nevertheless, the
idealization of a string as light and inextensible is an interesting
and informative limit: Rindler~\cite{rindler}, for example, considers
lowering a heavy object to the event horizon on the end of such a
string to illustrate energetic arguments in GR.

\section{The Schwarzschild metric}

The vacuum Einstein field equations for a static, spherically
symmetric mass are solved by the Schwarzschild
metric~\cite{schwarzschild1916}.  In units in which~$G=c=1$, this is:

\begin{equation}\label{schwarzschild}
\rmd s^2= -\rmd t^2\left(1-2M/r\right) +\frac{\rmd r^2}{1-2M/r} + r^2\left(\rmd\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta\rmd\phi^2\right).
\end{equation}

\noindent Here I consider the spatial component~$\rmd s^2=
\rmd r^2/\left(1-2M/r\right) + r^2\rmd\phi^2$, confined to equatorial
points~($\theta=\pi/2$); we understand~$r\geqslant 2M$ throughout.  A
circular string at constant~$r$ will, trivially, have proper
length~$2\pi r$.

Considering first the radial component we may calculate the
proper length $L\left(r_1,r_2\right)$ of a string stretching
from~$r=r_1\geqslant 2M$ to~$r_2\geqslant r_1$ at constant $\theta,\phi$:


% \begin{equation}\label{radial_string_length_properunits}
%   \int_{r=r_1}^{r_2}\frac{dr}{\sqrt{1-1/r}}=
%   \left.
%   \sqrt{r(r-1)} +\frac{1}{2}\log\left(
%   \frac{\sqrt{r}+\sqrt{r-1}}{\sqrt{r}-\sqrt{r-1}}\right)
%   \right|_{r_1}^{r_2}
%   \end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{radial_string_length}
  \int_{r=r_1}^{r_2}\frac{\rmd r}{\sqrt{1-2M/r}}=
  \left.
  \sqrt{r(r-2M)} +\frac{1}{2}\log\left(
  \frac{\sqrt{r}+\sqrt{r-2M}}{\sqrt{r}-\sqrt{r-2M}}\right)
  \right|_{r_1}^{r_2}
  \end{equation}

Observe that integration may be performed with a lower limit
of~$r_1=2M$ with no difficulty, even though the radial component of the
Schwarzschild metric approaches infinity there.

Elementary methods show that the proper length $\ell$ of radial
strings has some non-Euclidean features.  Firstly, consider the proper
length from $r=2M$ to $r=2M(1+w)$ where $w>0, \left|w\right|\ll 1$.
Then

%  \begin{equation}\label{ell_properunits}
%    \ell=\int_{r=1}^{r=1+w}ds
%    =2\sqrt{w} + \frac{1}{3}w^{3/2} + O(w^{5/2})
%  \end{equation}

 \begin{equation}\label{ell}
   \ell =
   \int_{r=2M}^{r=2M(1+w)}\rmd s
   =2M\left(2\sqrt{w} + \frac{1}{3}w^{3/2} + \Or(w^{5/2})\right)
 \end{equation}

(compare the flat space string length of $2Mw$).  This would indicate
 that, close to the Schwarzschild radius $r=2M$, large (but finite)
 amounts of string are required to connect two points with slightly
 differing radial coordinates.  Passing to the case $w\gg 1$ we have
 an asymptotic expansion that begins

% \begin{equation}\label{asymptotic_ell_properunits}
%   \ell = w +  \frac{1}{2}\log w + \frac{1}{2} + \log(2)  +  \frac{1}{8}w^{-1} + O(w^{-2}),
% \end{equation}
% 
\begin{equation}\label{asymptotic_ell}
  \ell = 2M\left(w +  \frac{1}{2}\log w + \frac{1}{2} + \log(2)  +  \frac{1}{8}w^{-1} + \Or(w^{-2})\right),
\end{equation}

\noindent suggesting that there is ``extra space'', sensible at large
distances from the event horizon, with radial strings being
arbitrarily longer than flat space would allow: a nice illustration of
the failure of Euclidean geometry.

\section{Nonradial string}
Integrating along a path between two
points~$p_1=\left(r_1,\phi_1\right)$ and~$p_2=\left(r_2,\phi_2\right)$
gives the {\em proper} length of the path, which is the length of an
inextensible string joining~$p_1$ and~$p_2$.  A taut but light string
from~$p_1$ to~$p_2$ will adopt an extremal-length path.  Such paths
may be found by the calculus of variations; parametrizing a curve in
terms of~$r=r\left(\phi\right)$ gives us a path length of

% \begin{equation}
% %  \int_{p_1}^{p_2}\sqrt{\frac{\left(r'\right)^2}{1-2M/r} + r^2}d\phi=
%   \int_{p_1}^{p_2}\left(\frac{\left(r'\right)^2}{1-1/r} + r^2\right)^\frac{1}{2}d\phi=
%   \int_{p_1}^{p_2}F\left(r,r'\right)d\phi
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
%  \int_{p_1}^{p_2}\sqrt{\frac{\left(r'\right)^2}{1-2M/r} + r^2}d\phi=
  \int_{p_1}^{p_2}\left(\frac{\left(r'\right)^2}{1-2M/r} + r^2\right)^\frac{1}{2}\rmd\phi=
  \int_{p_1}^{p_2}F\left(r,r'\right)\rmd\phi
\end{equation}

\noindent where dashes denote differentiation with respect to~$\phi$.
The Euler-Lagrange equations for this system,
$\frac{\rmd}{\rmd\phi}\frac{\partial F}{\partial r'}-\frac{\partial
  F}{\partial r}=0$ give an expression for the second derivative
of~$r$ (Mathematica idiom would be {\tt EulerEquations[Sqrt[y[x]\^{}2
      + y'[x]\^{}2/(1-1/y[x])],y[x],x]}):

\begin{equation}\label{rdashdash}
  r''\left(\phi\right) =
  (r-2M) + \frac{(2r-3M)\left(r'\right)^2}{r\left(r-2M\right)},\qquad r>2M.
\end{equation}

\noindent Solutions to equation~\ref{rdashdash} correspond to a taut
string confined to Flamm's paraboloid~\cite{flamm1916}; see
Figure~\ref{flamm}.  It is interesting to compare
equation~\ref{rdashdash} with the corresponding equation for null
geodesics, which is usually given~\cite{wald} in terms of $u=2M/r$ as
$u''=3u^2/2-u$, but is equivalent
to~$r''\left(\phi\right)=r-3M+2\left(r'\right)^2/r$.  This shows that
light, being sensitive to the time component of the metric, behaves
differently from string, which is not (recall that a straight line in
flat space, $r=r_0\sec\left(\phi-\phi_0\right)$, obeys
$r''=r+2\left(r'\right)^2/r$).

There does not appear to be a simple analytical solution to
equation~\ref{rdashdash}; but it is a straightforward second order
ODE, amenable to numerical solution and no harder than the equivalent
for null geodesics.  Here we consider
only strings exterior to the event horizon, $r>2M$, which have a
well-defined point of closest approach to the singularity.  Because
the system is invariant under~$\phi\longrightarrow-\phi$, the string
must be symmetrical about this point.  If $\phi'$ is small, then a
string follows $r''=r-2M$, while tangential null geodesics follow
$r''=r-3M$.  Thus a taut string would {\em look} curved to a local
observer, having a (visual) radius of curvature of
$r_0^2/M\sqrt{1-2M/r_0}$ (the extra term comes from the fact that
appearance is driven by local $ds$, not Schwarzschild $r$).  At the
photon sphere $r_0=3M$, such a string would appear to have a radius
of~$\sqrt{27}M$.  For a solar mass black hole this would be about
$15\unit{km}$, a readily understandable result.


\section{Numerical results}

Here I solve equation~\ref{rdashdash} numerically, using the R
programming language~\cite{rcore2019} and the \verb+deSolve+ package
for ordinary differential equations~\cite{soetart2010}.  First we
consider strings for which $r>2M$ everywhere (that is, completely
exterior strings).
Figure~\ref{closest_approach_non_self_intersecting} shows a sequence
of non-self-intersecting numerical solutions to
equation~\ref{rdashdash}, rotated so that the tangential point of
closest approach occurs at~$\phi=0$.
Figure~\ref{closest_approach_self_intersecting} shows the
corresponding diagram for self-interesecting strings
(Figure~\ref{light_closest_approach} shows equivalent null geodesics
for comparison).  A bisection technique reveals that if the closest
approach is greater than a critical value of about~$\simeq 1.0761\cdot
2M$, the string does not self-intersect; if the closest approach is
less than this value, then the string crosses itself at~$\phi=\pi/2$.

There are other ways to parametrize completely exterior strings;
Figure \ref{strings_r_equals_2}, for example, shows strings passing
through~$(4M,0)$.  Figure~\ref{light_r_equals_2} shows light paths for
comparison.

\section{Discussion}

The concept of ``straight line'' is problematic in general relativity.
Although photon paths provide a definition of straightness, their
world lines are sensitive to the time component of the metric.  Light
taut strings respond only to the spatial components of the metric, and
their configuration is arguably a more intuitive and helpful way to
think about straightness.  Using numerical methods to compute string
configuration is suitable for an undergraduate homework problem.
