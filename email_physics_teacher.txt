Following email sent to me by Gary White, editor of "The Physics
Teacher", 20 December 2019:

I also want to clarify that The Physics Teacher concerns itself with
the introductory classroom, so while I think many teachers of physics
(writ large) might benefit from the insights in your article, I have
concluded that the teacher of "introductory physics" is unlikely to
see how to leverage it for their classroom. However, if you were
interested in framing your results in a way that presumes little
beyond the typical first year course, wherein you start by gently
guiding our Newtonian-world-view readers what the "metric" is, and
then carefully explain the similarities and differences between the
three kinds of "straight lines" that you mention, and linking wherever
you can to actual current practical applications of general relativity
such as the GPS system, and to possibilities for using your results as
part of (say) a pedagogical unit on bringing general relativity into
the introductory sequence, then I would be very interested in such an
article for TPT. Such an article would still need to stay close to our
benchmark length of 2000 words, but details about numerical solutions
to differential equations could be moved to appendices intended to be
viewed online only.
